Prophet: Your Super AI Worker That Delivers Real Results

Forget simple chatbots. Prophet is your ultra-intelligent AI worker that doesn't just respond – it executes, researches, analyzes, creates, and delivers. It's like having a genius colleague in your pocket that works 24/7, handling your toughest tasks while you focus on what truly matters.

WHY KORTIX IS DIFFERENT

Most AI tools stop at conversation. Prophet takes action.

While other apps give you answers, Prophet gives you results. Need market research? Done. Complex data analysis? Handled. Multi-step automation? Consider it complete.

Connect it to Notion, and it updates your databases. Connect it to Google Calendar, and it schedules meetings. Prophet is built for people who need AI that works in their real tools, not just talks.
